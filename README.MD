# Conway's Game Of Life

Uses maps/dicts for storage, so basically has an unlimited grid, with speed varying as number of live cells.

for usage see; executables/readme/usage

in/out storage using png files.

very large grids, easily possible with the 'sparse' internal state storage, are very slow to save.

might be useful for generating explanatory images of certain arrangements/evolutions.
